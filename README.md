# Predicting-Speed-Dating-Matches
Data Science Programming with Python summer course final project:

The goal of this project was to predict outcomes in speed dating interactions using a rich dataset from a controlled speed-dating experiment. The dataset included demographic information, self-assessments, and ratings of various attributes such as attractiveness, humor, and intelligence. We aimed to identify the key factors influencing mutual matches and develop predictive models to classify whether two individuals would express mutual interest.

Our process began with extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in age, self-confidence, personality traits, and shared interests that correlated with successful matches. We engineered features like similarity scores for personality traits and differences in attribute importance to enhance the dataset's predictive power. After feature engineering, we applied and evaluated multiple models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and boosting methods. These models provided insights into variable importance and offered a range of predictive accuracies, with Random Forest achieving the best results.

This project highlights the complex interplay of human preferences and provides a data-driven perspective on romantic compatibility, offering a foundation for further exploration or application in matchmaking technologies.
